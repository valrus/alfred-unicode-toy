# unicode-toy

unicode-toy is an [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow based on
Eli the Bearded's "[Unicode Text Converter](https://qaz.wtf/u/convert.cgi)."

Trigger this workflow using the `u` keyword, then type the phrase you want to
convert. Then select from the list of Unicode translations to copy one to the
clipboard and paste it into the frontmost app.
