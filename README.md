# unicode-toy

unicode-toy is an [Alfred] workflow based on
Eli the Bearded's "[Unicode Text Converter]."

Trigger this workflow using the `u` keyword, then type the phrase you want to
convert. Then select from the list of Unicode translations to copy one to the
clipboard and paste it into the frontmost app.
